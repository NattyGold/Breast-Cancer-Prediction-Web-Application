Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women globally, accounting for the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a major public health problem in the world.

Early diagnosis of breast cancer can dramatically improve prognosis and chances of survival, as it can promote timely clinical treatment of patients.more precise classification of benign tumours can prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary treatments.

So, In this project we are going to make prediction to breast cancer using Wincosin Breast Cancer Dataset.
